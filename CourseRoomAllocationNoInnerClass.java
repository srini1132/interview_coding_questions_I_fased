/**
 * Problem Statement:
 *
 * Given: 2 integer arrays, one integer 'n'
 *      Here 1st Array having course start time (like if value is 1 it is 1:00AM and if value is 13 it is 1:00PM)
 *      And in 2nd array we are having duration of course in hours with respective index to 1st array
 *      Ex: 1st array [2,13], 2nd array [14,1] here array size 2 so count of courses we have 2
 *          course 1 started at 2(2:00AM) and duration is 14 hours so this course can complete by 2 + 14 = 16(4:00PM)
 *          course 2 started at 13(1:00PM) and duration is 1 hour so this course can complete by 13 + 1 = 14(2:00PM)
 *
 *      And integer 'n' rooms available to conduct course. Here in 1 room we can conduct 1 course at a time
 *
 * Then:
 *      Need to find which room has chance to run maximum numbers of courses
 *
 *
 * Example:
 *  int roomCount = 2;
 *  int[] courseStartTimeArray = {1, 2, 5};
 *  int[] courseDurationArray = {6, 1, 2};
 *
 *  Output: 2
 *
 *  If in 1st room course 1 started at 1 and duration is 6, so room can free by 1 + 6 = 7
 *  And in 2nd room course 2 started at 2 and duration is 1, so room can free by 2 + 1 = 3
 *  Here 3rd course need to start by 5 and room 1 not in free till 7, so we can not take room 1 for course 3
 *  and by this time room is free, so course can conduct in room 2 only.
 *
 *  Here room 2 has chance to conduct maximum number of courses
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *  Note: Here I am checking for free room always in the order 1 to n
